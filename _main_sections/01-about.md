I'm **Tankery**, a man who belief in tech, belief that tech is the power of social progress.
Also love design, which can turn that boring, complicated tech into a elegance, concise surface.
I hope that in my career, I can create lots of stuff that delights people.

Graduate from Huazhong University of Science & Tech, also a member of Dian Group. During that days, I finished lots of course project for software and hardware.

After graduate, I'm focusing on the Android development.
I've improved WebKit kernal for Dolphin Browser, created a music player Pace for runners, and now build Fitness/Music Apps for smartwatches.
