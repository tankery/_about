My own blog site - [Fly the Code](//blog.tankery.me), most writen in Chinese, is a place to record my thoughts and learnings.

The website is hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Its domain is bought from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), build from scracth using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

You can checkout the code of [this page](https://github.com/tankery/_about) and [blog site](https://github.com/tankery/_blog). They are both open soursed. Hope it can help you.
